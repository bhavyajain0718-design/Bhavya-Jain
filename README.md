# 👋 Hi, I’m Bhavya

### 🧠 DeFi Protocol Builder | Smart Contract Engineer | Security-Focused Learner

I rebuild DeFi protocols from scratch to deeply understand their **mechanics, risks, and security** — not just how to deploy them.

Focused on writing **secure, tested, production-grade smart contracts** that can safely handle real money.
